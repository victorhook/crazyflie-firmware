# Crazyflie Firmware for the Slamdeck
This repository is a fork from the original Crazyflie firmware, found [here](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware). It contains extensions to the existing firmware of the Crazyflie, that enables the Slamdeck. It was developed during my bachelor's thesis project and contains the following adjustments:

- Deck driver for the Slamdeck
- Separated `CPX` into multiple files
- Added a `CPX` port to `crtp.h`
